For my computer player, I made it to prioritize picking the corner move if if is in the legal move list. If no corner move available,
it would then prioritize picking the edge move since the edge move can only be swapped by 2 directions. If no edge move available,
then it would pick the move that flip the most tile from the opposite color.

The computer is smart but still very defeatable if I concentrate and play carefully. The computer defeated me about 70% at the time
when I did testing runs.

For improvement, I would rank each move with points and pick the move that has the most points as computer's best move. This is because
of my current computer move algorithm prioritizing corner move then edge move and finally most flippable move. But it did not account for
which edge move can flip the most tiles as in the method to get the edge move, it would loop through the coordinate of all the edge moves
to see if they are in the legal-move list. Thus, it would return the last edge move coordinate in the legal-move list without choosing 
the best edge move that can flip the most tiles.
